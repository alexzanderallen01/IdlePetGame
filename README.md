# Overview

This is the first try at making a tutorial area for a game project me and a friend are trying to create. 
The demo includes a small map that you can look and move around in. You are able to pick up crates using 
left click & drop it on pressure plates to open more areas. You have a cat that will follow you around 
and will attack enemies close to you in later updates to the project. There is also a goblin that you will
be able to fight later to open another area of the map.

The purpose for writing this software is for me to learn the basics of unity and scripting so that I can being 
trying to create the ideas me and a friend have been working on for a while now. While I have a spread sheet 
of enemy and pet states, as well as how scaling working, I did not have the knowledge on how to use any of 
that data. This project is to help me build the foundation to use my other skills to make a game.

The demo is split into 2 parts as xbox game bar can only record 1 app and can not record your screen.
Part one is what 1 did in unity and part 2 is all of my scripting.

# Development Environment

The 2 main tools I used was Unity and VS Code. I used VS Code to create and edit my scripts while Unity 
is what I used to create my game environment and use apply my scripts. I also use the Unity asset store
to get a bunch of free assets in order to create my environment. I used C# to code my scripts as that 
is the language that Unity works with. As I have a good understanding, it made it easier to get into
scripting quickly allowing me to focus on learning how to use all of unity's tools. I didn't use 
any libraries out side of unity's default library to my knowledge, but I did use unity's default library
a lot to be able to detect when keys are pressed, where the mouse is looking, ect.

# Useful Websites

* [packtpub](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/intro-to-unity-game-development-made-easy-9781837029952)
    I followed this intro to unity tutoral in oder to learn the basics of unity's tools and the basics of
    how I can use C# with unity to do things. This give me the foundation needed to create my own project
    and try to do things my self.
* [assetstore](https://assetstore.unity.com) This website was the most useful site for me once I gained a
    basic understanding of how to use unity as it allowed me to easily get good looking assets for free.
    Without this site this game would be made out of colored blocks and spheres.
* [youtube](https://www.youtube.com) This site was really helpful to me for multilple challenges like making
    doors that open and how to create GUIs, as the videos I used would show the objects they attached to game objects.
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)  This website is the main place I went to when ever I 
    had errors I did not understand or could not figure out how to do something.  

# Future Work

* enemies need their own HP
* Enemies need to be able to damage the player & pets need to be able to damage enemies
* make a script to detect when the first enemy dies to trigger the open door script on the first single door.
